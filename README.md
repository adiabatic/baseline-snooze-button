# Baseline Snooze Button

I like reading about new things that web browsers support, but I try to only care when they work in all three main browser engines and not just one or two.

This Deno program will read the contents of <https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features> that youâ€™ve previously `git clone`d to your computer and spit out a long YAML list of features that are Baseline High (been working in all three engines for a while).

If you care about people using slightly older browsers, modify `output` so it gets the stringified YAML version of `highs`, not `lows`, and run it again.

## Making it go

Assuming you have Deno installed, either run `deno task clone` or inspect `deno.json` to see what Git repository you want to clone (maybe you prefer HTTPS clones).

Then run `deno task once`. You can, of course, run it more than once.

## Further work

It sure would be cool if someone made an [Atom][] feed of this kind of information.
